        <a>About me<a>
        <p>I am an undergraduate student in the Physics program at the Institute of Physics of the University of SÃ£o Paulo (IFUSP). During my studies, I aim to build a solid foundation in physics and mathematics, in addition to exploring topics of personal interest in greater depth, with the goal of becoming a researcher in theoretical physics in the future. Currently, I am interested in learning Differential Geometry and deepening my knowledge of Quantum Mechanics.</p>
